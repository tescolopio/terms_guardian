## Introduction

The Terms Guardian project aims to help everyday people understand complex terms and conditions, agreements, and other contracts commonly found on the internet. Ensuring the security of this project is crucial to maintaining user trust and protecting sensitive information. Security is a top priority and integral to our mission.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all aspects of the Terms Guardian project, including code, data, documentation, and infrastructure.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Maintainers**: Responsible for enforcing the security policy and ensuring compliance.

## Security Practices

### Code Security
- Perform regular code reviews to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Use static code analysis tools to detect security issues before code is merged.
- Follow secure coding practices and guidelines, such as OWASP.

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest using standards like AES-256.
- Implement data anonymization and pseudonymization where appropriate.
- Regularly audit data access and storage practices.

### Access Control
