# Understanding Terms Guardian's Grading System

## Overview

Terms Guardian evaluates legal documents using two complementary assessment methods:

1. **User Rights Index**: Evaluates how well a legal document respects and protects your rights
2. **Readability Assessment**: Measures how easy the document is to understand

This guide explains our methodology in plain language so you can better understand your results.

## User Rights Index

### What We Measure

The User Rights Index evaluates legal documents across eight key areas:

| Category | Weight | What We Look For |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Clarity & Transparency** | 20% | Plain language, clear structure, helpful summaries |
| **Data Collection & Use** | 25% | Specific data types, clear purposes, user controls |
| **User Privacy** | 20% | Security measures, regulatory compliance, privacy protections |
| **Content Rights** | 15% | Who owns user content, licensing terms, content control |
| **Account Management** | 10% | Account deletion, data export, security options |
| **Dispute Resolution** | 10% | Fair conflict resolution, legal options, accessibility |
| **Terms Changes** | 5% | How changes are communicated, notice periods |
| **Algorithmic Decisions** | 5% | Transparency about automated processes |

### How Scoring Works

Each category receives a score from 1-10:
- **1-3**: Poor protection of user rights
- **4-6**: Basic protection with significant limitations
- **7-9**: Strong protection with minor limitations
- **10**: Exceptional protection that goes beyond standard practices

These scores are weighted and combined to create an overall score from 0-100.

### Letter Grade System

Terms Guardian translates scores into traditional letter grades to make assessment results immediately recognizable:

#### User Rights Index Grades

| Score Range | Letter Grade | Protection Level |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| 97-100 | **A+** | Outstanding protection that exceeds all standards |
| 93-96.9 | **A** | Excellent protection with no significant concerns |
| 90-92.9 | **A-** | Very strong protection with minimal concerns |
| 87-89.9 | **B+** | Good protection with few minor concerns |
| 83-86.9 | **B** | Solid protection with some minor concerns |
| 80-82.9 | **B-** | Above average protection with several minor concerns |
| 77-79.9 | **C+** | Adequate protection with some notable concerns |
| 73-76.9 | **C** | Average protection with multiple concerns |
| 70-72.9 | **C-** | Below average protection with significant concerns |
| 67-69.9 | **D+** | Weak protection with major gaps |
| 63-66.9 | **D** | Poor protection with serious deficiencies |
| 60-62.9 | **D-** | Very poor protection with critical gaps |
| 50-59.9 | **F+** | Inadequate protection of user rights |
| 40-49.9 | **F** | Severely deficient protection |
| 0-39.9 | **F-** | Virtually no meaningful user rights protection |

### Red Flags

Terms Guardian identifies particularly concerning terms that may:
- Grant unlimited rights to your data or content
- Force mandatory arbitration
- Prevent class action lawsuits
- Allow selling your personal information without clear opt-out options
- Allow changing terms without notice

These are highlighted separately from the overall score to help you quickly identify important concerns.

## Readability Assessment

### What We Measure

Our readability assessment evaluates how difficult the document is to understand by analyzing:

1. **Sentence Length**: Longer sentences are harder to process
2. **Word Complexity**: Uncommon or technical words increase difficulty
3. **Overall Structure**: How the content is organized and presented
4. **Legal Jargon Density**: The concentration of specialized legal terminology

### Scoring Methods

We use several established readability formulas, including:

- **Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**: Estimates the US grade level needed to understand the text
- **Flesch Reading Ease**: Scores from 0-100, with higher scores indicating easier reading
- **SMOG Index**: Measures years of education needed to understand the text

### Readability Grading Scale

Since legal documents are typically more complex than everyday text, our readability grading scale is adjusted to recognize that context:

| Flesch Reading Ease | Letter Grade | Education Level | Interpretation for Legal Text |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| 80-100 | **A+** | 5th-6th grade | Exceptionally clear, rare for legal documents |
| 75-79.9 | **A** | 6th-7th grade | Excellent clarity, accessible to most readers |
| 70-74.9 | **A-** | 7th grade | Very clear, minimal specialized knowledge needed |
| 65-69.9 | **B+** | 8th grade | Good clarity, understandable to most adults |
| 60-64.9 | **B** | 8th-9th grade | Clear plain English, better than most legal texts |
| 55-59.9 | **B-** | 9th-10th grade | Above average clarity for legal documents |
| 50-54.9 | **C+** | 10th-11th grade | Moderately complex but acceptable |
| 45-49.9 | **C** | 11th-12th grade | Average complexity for legal documents |
| 40-44.9 | **C-** | Early college | Below average, more complex than necessary |
| 35-39.9 | **D+** | College | Difficult for many readers |
| 30-34.9 | **D** | College graduate | Very difficult, unnecessarily complex |
| 25-29.9 | **D-** | Graduate school | Extremely difficult, excessive complexity |
| 20-24.9 | **F+** | Professional | Unnecessarily complex and inaccessible |
| 10-19.9 | **F** | Legal expert | Nearly incomprehensible to non-experts |
| 0-9.9 | **F-** | Specialist | Deliberately obscure or overly complex |

Most legal documents score between 30-50 (D+ to C range), making them difficult for the average person to understand without specialized knowledge. Documents scoring in the B range or higher demonstrate a commitment to clarity and accessibility.

## Understanding Your Results

### Overall Assessment

Terms Guardian combines both the User Rights Index and Readability scores to give you a complete picture of the document. A good legal document should both protect your rights AND be written in language you can understand.

### Combined Grade

The overall grade reflects both how well your rights are protected and how accessible the document is:

| Component Grades | Overall Grade | What It Means |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Both A range | **A** | Excellent document that respects rights and is clearly written |
| Mix of A and B | **B+** | Very good document with strong rights protection and good clarity |
| Both B range | **B** | Good document that balances rights and readability well |
| Mix of B and C | **C+** | Above average document with room for improvement |
| Both C range | **C** | Average document typical of most services |
| Any D component | **C-** or lower | Below average document with significant concerns |
| Any F component | **D** or lower | Poor document with major deficiencies |
| Both F range | **F** | Unacceptable document that neither protects rights nor communicates clearly |

### Recommendations

Based on your results, Terms Guardian provides tailored recommendations that may include:

- Specific areas of concern to review more closely
- Questions to ask before accepting terms
- Alternative options if available
- Resources for further information

### Limitations

Our assessment provides valuable guidance but has limitations:

- **Not Legal Advice**: Terms Guardian cannot replace professional legal counsel
- **Automated Analysis**: While comprehensive, our system may miss nuances that a legal professional would catch
- **Evolving Standards**: Legal standards and best practices change over time

## Taking Action

After reviewing your results, consider:

1. **Reading Key Sections**: Focus on sections with low scores or red flags
2. **Seeking Clarification**: Contact the company if terms are unclear
3. **Considering Alternatives**: If major red flags exist, consider alternative services
4. **Documenting Concerns**: Save your assessment results for future reference

## Methodology Details

### User Rights Components

#### Clarity and Transparency (20%)
We analyze the document's readability level, structure quality, jargon density, and the presence of summaries or visual aids. Clear documents use plain language, logical organization, and helpful explanations of complex terms.

#### Data Collection and Use (25%)
We evaluate how specifically the document describes what data is collected, why it's collected, who it's shared with, how long it's kept, and what control you have over it. Better documents clearly list data types, specific purposes, and provide straightforward controls.

#### User Privacy (20%)
We examine security measures, compliance with privacy laws, breach notification policies, and data anonymization practices. Strong documents explain specific protections and comply with major privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

#### Content Rights (15%)
We assess who owns content you create, what rights you grant to the service, and your ability to control or delete your content. Better documents let you retain ownership with limited, specific licenses only needed for providing the service.

#### Account Management (10%)
We evaluate how easily you can delete your account, export your data, and manage security settings. User-friendly services offer simple self-service tools and clear processes.

#### Dispute Resolution (10%)
We analyze how conflicts are resolved, including arbitration requirements, class action restrictions, and jurisdiction specifications. Fair systems provide accessible options without excessive restrictions on legal rights.

#### Terms Changes (5%)
We check how changes to terms are communicated, how much notice is provided, and whether you can reject changes. Better practices include advance notice, change summaries, and continued access under previous terms.

#### Algorithmic Decisions (5%)
We evaluate transparency around automated decision-making that affects users. Better documents explain when algorithms are used, what factors they consider, and provide options for human review.

### Readability Analysis

Our readability assessment analyzes:

- **Vocabulary Complexity**: Percentage of uncommon or specialized words
- **Sentence Structure**: Average sentence length and complexity
- **Document Structure**: Organization, headings, and formatting
- **Legal Jargon Density**: Concentration of legal terminology

For technical users, we employ these formulas:
- Flesch Reading Ease: 206.835 - (1.015 × ASL) - (84.6 × ASW)
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: (0.39 × ASL) + (11.8 × ASW) - 15.59

Where:
- ASL = Average Sentence Length (words per sentence)
- ASW = Average Syllables per Word
