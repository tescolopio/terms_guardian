In medieval history these fraternities or guilds played an important part in the government of some states; as at Florence, in the thirteenth and following centuries, where they chose the council of government of the city. But with the growth of cities and the ad-vance in the organization of municipal gov-ernment, thelr importance and prestige has declined. The place of meeting of a guild, or assoclatlon of guilds, was called the “Guildhall.” The word is said to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon “gild” or “geld,” a tax or tribute, because each member of the society was required to pay a tax towards its support",
