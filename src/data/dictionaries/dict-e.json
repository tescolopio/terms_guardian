It is so called because it is in the choice or election of the plaintiff whether he will sue out this writ or a fl. fa. By it the defendant’s goods and chattels are ap-praised and all of them (except oxen and beasts of the plow) are delivered to the plaintiff, at such reasonable appraisement and price, in part satisfaction of his debt If the goods are not sufficient, then the mole* ty of his freehold lands, which he had at the time of the judgment given, are also to be delivered to the plaintiff, to hold till out of the rents and profits thereof the debt be lev ied, or till the defendant’s interest be expired. During this period the plaintiff is called “tenant by elegit,” and his estate, an “es-tate by elegit.” This writ, or Its analogue, is in use in some of the United States, ns Virginia and Kentucky.
