But pleas between subject and subject were anciently heard there, untii this was for-bidden by the Artivula super Cliartas, (1290,) after which its jurisdiction as a court oniy extended to revenue cases arising out of the non-payment or withholding of debts to the crown. But the privilege of suing and beiug sued in this court was extended to the king’s accountants, and later, by the use of a convenient fiction to the effect that the plain-tiff was the king's debtor or accountant, the court was thrown open to all suitors in per-sonal actions. The exchequer had formerly both an equity side and a common-law side, • but its equity jurisdiction was taken away by the statute 5 Vict. c. 5, (1842,) and trans-ferred to the court of chancery.
